	<p>This project is my home base for all social media links and a showcase of my personal coding projects. Here, you will find a selection of projects that demonstrate my skills and abilities as a web developer.</p>
	<p>Some of the technologies I have used in this project include Gulp, SaSS, Express, and NodeJS. These tools have helped me to create a fast, efficient, and user-friendly portfolio site that is easy to navigate and showcases my work in a professional manner.</p>
	<p>The project is licensed under the CCA 3.0 license from html5up.net, which allows for free use for personal and commercial purposes. If you would like to use any of the code or resources from this project, please be sure to credit me and include a link to this project's repository.</p>
	<p>Demo images* for this project were provided by Unsplash, a collection of CC0 (public domain) images. These images were a great resource for adding visual appeal to the site, and I am grateful for their use. Icons for this project were sourced from Font Awesome (fontawesome.io), a popular library of scalable vector icons that are easy to customize and integrate into web projects.</p>
	<p>In addition to the above technologies, this project also uses jQuery (jquery.com), Scrollex (github.com/ajlkn/jquery.scrollex), and Responsive Tools (github.com/ajlkn/responsive-tools). These libraries and tools have helped me to create a responsive, mobile-friendly design that looks great on all devices. The logo image for this project can be found at https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_3d1f7341-2fb8-43db-ad77-ad5216d271a0?wid=488&hei=488&fmt=pjpeg with a size of "100%".</p>
