	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>This project is my home base for all social media links and a showcase of my personal coding projects. Here, you will find a selection of projects that demonstrate my skills and abilities as a web developer.</p>
	<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
	<p>Some of the technologies I have used in this project include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start">Gulp</a>: A popular task runner that helps automate development tasks such as linting, testing, and building.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation">SaSS</a>: A powerful CSS preprocessor that adds features such as variables, nesting, and mixins to CSS, making it easier to write and maintain.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html">Express</a>: A minimalist web framework for Node.js that helps with routing, middleware, and other web application functionality.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/">Node.js</a>: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.

	</ul>
	<p>These tools have helped me to create a fast, efficient, and user-friendly portfolio site that is easy to navigate and showcases my work in a professional manner.</p>

	<h2>Images and Icons</h2>
	<p>Demo images* for this project were provided by Unsplash, a collection of CC0 (public domain) images. These images were a great resource for adding visual appeal to the site, and I am grateful for their use. Icons for this project were sourced from Font Awesome (fontawesome.io), a popular library of scalable vector icons that are easy to customize and integrate into web projects.</p>
	<h2>Other Tools and Libraries</h2>
	<p>In addition to the above technologies, this project also uses:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="https://api.jquery.com/">jQuery</a>: A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that makes HTML DOM manipulation, event handling, and animation much simpler.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/ajlkn/jquery.scrollex">Scrollex</a>: A jQuery plugin for creating scroll-triggered events, such as animating elements as you scroll down the page.
